# RFENet

The code for the paper "Surface Mesh Reconstruction from Medical Images via Enrichment Feature Learning and Mesh Contour Loss", which is accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics, 2025.12.

Our code is based on [Vox2Cortex](https://github.com/ai-med/Vox2Cortex?tab=readme-ov-file) and [voxel2mesh](https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/voxel2mesh).

The code and detailed implementation will be updated soon.
